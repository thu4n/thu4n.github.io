After nearly a year since the last blog, I am back and still an intern (maybe senior intern). What's great is that I got the chance to explore multiple working cultures and environments in such a short span of time. Even though it's only a few months in each of these places, there were notable differences between them that inspired me to make this blog. 

## A little backstory

My first internship at Bosch ended with the classic *“no headcount”* story. After that, I moved on to be a DevOps intern at CODE LEAP, a German IT consulting startup, and later at NAB Innovation Centre Vietnam, the tech hub of National Australia Bank. From CODE LEAP’s fast pace to NAB’s well-defined structure, the shift was eye-opening.

## Interview process

The startup’s interview process can be summed up in one word: fast. Each step was about a day or two apart, and I got the result just a day after the last round. Smooth and professional. The bank’s process, on the other hand, took more time—multiple rounds, each spaced out, and even an online coding test (which felt a bit odd for DevOps). Still, it made sense given the number of applicants they receive.

## Workplace experiences

### The general vibe

CODE LEAP was full of energy, I felt it right from my first day of joining. HR guided me around the office and introduced me to *everyone* there. During lunch, food will be ordered as a small welcome party and you introduced yourself again to the whole company. It was fun. On a regular day, the office always felt alive: being a small team, you’d see people huddled in meeting rooms brainstorming or collaborating right at their desks.

NAB, on the other hand, was a lot more organized and a bit distant. My entire first day was spent in a meeting room with other interns, learning about NAB’s processes and all the different departments and teams. There was a pizza party afterwards, but it was just us interns hanging out together. On a typical day, plenty of things were happening across the organization, but they were less visible. You’d hear about projects and changes rather than see them, unless they directly involved your team.
